# S&P 500 ESG & Financial Analysis Project
This repository contains a series of quantitative analyses performed on the S&P 500 dataset to explore the relationship between ESG ratings and financial metrics. The project was developed to demonstrate data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis skills using Python.
The project is divided into three main notebooks:
1.  **Sector Analysis:** benchmarking ESG scores across GICS sectors to identify industry trends.
2.  **Volatility Strategy:** comparing "Low Volatility" vs "High Growth" portfolios to test ESG performance.
3.  **Debt & ESG:** investigating the correlation between corporate leverage (Debt-to-Equity) and sustainability ratings.

### Tech Stack
* **Python:** Pandas (Data Cleaning, Grouping, Merging), NumPy.
* **Data Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib.
* **Statistics:** Correlation analysis, Quartile binning (`qcut`), Aggregation.

### Disclaimer
This project is for educational and portfolio demonstration purposes only. It does not constitute financial advice, nor is it intended to be a scientifically rigorous academic study. The primary goal is to train technical proficiency in Python for Data Analysis.
