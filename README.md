Analysis of ESG scores vs Financial Performance in S&amp;P 500 using Python.
This project investigates the financial materiality of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria within the S&P 500 equity universe. Utilizing Python for data manipulation and statistical analysis, the study explores the intersection of sustainability ratings, capital structure, and market volatility. The primary objective is to determine whether ESG factors serve as a constraint on financial performance or, conversely, act as a proxy for quality and risk mitigation in portfolio construction.

Study 1: Sectoral Benchmarking and Valuation
The initial phase of the research focuses on the distribution of ESG scores across the 11 GICS sectors to evaluate the feasibility of a diversified sustainable portfolio. The analysis challenges the assumption that high sustainability ratings are exclusive to low-emission industries. While the Technology sector exhibits the highest average scores, significant variance within the Energy and Utilities sectors supports a "best-in-class" selection approach over negative screening. Furthermore, a quantitative assessment of risk reveals a negative correlation of -0.09 between ESG scores and 30-day price volatility. Although the linear relationship is weak, the directional trend indicates that superior sustainability ratings are associated with lower idiosyncratic risk. Finally, the application of a "High ESG / Low Valuation" screening algorithm successfully identified undervalued opportunities, such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), which combines a perfect ESG score with a discounted Price-to-Earnings ratio, demonstrating that value investing principles can be effectively integrated with sustainability mandates.

Study 2: Volatility vs. Growth Strategy Analysis
The second component of the study juxtaposes two distinct hypothetical investment strategies to assess the "cost" of sustainability. A Defensive portfolio, comprised of the lowest volatility decile, was compared against an Aggressive portfolio containing the highest growth constituents. The results indicate a strong synergy between capital preservation and sustainability. The Defensive portfolio yielded a significantly higher average ESG score of 7.86 compared to the 6.80 average of the Aggressive portfolio. Moreover, the sustainable portfolio trades at a more attractive valuation multiple. These findings suggest that investors prioritizing low volatility do not incur a "green premium" but rather inherently acquire a more sustainable portfolio, reinforcing the view of ESG as a risk-mitigation tool synonymous with stability.

Study 3: Corporate Leverage and Sustainability Correlation
The final analysis examines the relationship between financial health, specifically the Debt-to-Equity ratio, and ESG performance. The underlying hypothesis posits that highly leveraged firms would deprioritize sustainability initiatives due to financial constraints. However, the empirical evidence contradicts this view. Companies in the highest leverage quartile exhibited a superior average ESG score of 7.69 compared to those with low leverage at 7.33. This phenomenon is attributed to the capital-intensive nature of regulated sectors such as Utilities and Infrastructure, where high debt levels are often deployed for energy transition projects and are accompanied by rigorous reporting requirements. Consequently, high leverage in this context should not be viewed as a detractor for ESG performance but potentially as a signal of funded capital expenditure toward sustainable infrastructure.

Methodology and Technical Stack
The analysis was conducted using a robust Python-based data science stack. Pandas and NumPy were utilized for data cleaning, aggregation, and the calculation of financial quartiles, while Seaborn and Matplotlib were employed for data visualization and the identification of distributional outliers. Statistical validation was performed using Pearson correlation coefficients to assess linear relationships between non-financial and financial variables. The complete code and datasets are available within this repository for reproducibility.
